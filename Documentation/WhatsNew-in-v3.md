# Literata 3.0

**Version 3.0 design notes**  


### What is new?  

In v3.0 Literata was expanded to a broader type family. The range of weights has been extended and an optical axis added to the design space. As a result the type family has grown from 8 styles to 50. These are distributed in 4 optical size series where the display one features the full range of weights and the caption series a reduced range that is more appropriate for small texts. 

The variable font provides access to the complete design space that is, in essence, a rectangle based on two axes. But the named instances are limited to the weights that are recommended for each optical size.




### What has changed?

As a result of the broader design space the typographic colour of the new Bold and Semibold styles is different from the previous version. Both weights are now heavier. In order to achieve a typographic colour tgat matches the Literata 2.0 styles we recommend these positions in the weight axis:

Medium: 450

Semibold: 505

Bold: 580


### What was improved?

Many things, some of them visible and some of them not. Kerning was refined in the regular style. All anchors were repositioned and accents rebuilt. A cleaner approach was taken in regards to certain letter pairs. Combining diacritics were rebuilt and now support a better result when building accented glyphs that are not included in the font. While the language support has not changed the character set suffered some changes, and some unnecessary characters and a few doubled characters were removed.
